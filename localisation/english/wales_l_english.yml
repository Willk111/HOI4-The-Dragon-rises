 WAL_the_trade_union_pact:0 "The Trade Union Pact"
 WAL_the_trade_union_pact_desc:0 "The strength of our democracy lies not in the halls of power, but in the hands of its people.

This pact will bind our nation together in fairness, solidarity, and shared purpose."
 
 WAL_allies_in_london:0 "Allies in London"

 WAL_workers_councils:0 "Workers' Councils"
 WAL_workers_councils_desc:0 "The lifeblood of Wales flows through its workers — the miners, the steelmen, the factory hands who built this nation with sweat and struggle. No longer will they answer to absentee owners or foreign profiteers. Every factory, every dock, every mine shall belong to those who labor within them. Through the creation of Workers’ Councils, industry will be guided by the will of the people, not the greed of the few. From now on, Cymru’s wealth will serve its people — not the other way around."

 WAL_welsh_soviet_pact_desc:0 "From the valleys of Cymru to the steppes of Russia, the voice of the worker cries out in unison!

 WAL_a_welsh_internationale:0 "A Welsh Internationale"
 WAL_a_welsh_internationale_desc:0 "To lead an Internationale is to shape thought as well as arms.

 # Fascist Path
 WAL_rise_of_the_dragon:0 "The Rise of the Dragon"
 WAL_rise_of_the_dragon_desc:0 "The old world has failed. Democracy falters, socialism divides, and foreign influence poisons our soil.

 WAL_purging_british_influence:0 "Purging British Influence"
 WAL_purging_british_influence_desc:0 "For centuries, British rule sought not only to govern Wales but to erase it — our language silenced, our people shamed, our children made to wear the cursed Welsh Knot for speaking their mother tongue. No more. Those days of humiliation will be avenged through decisive reform and renewal. British officials will be removed from our institutions, their laws undone, their symbols erased. The tongue once punished shall now command, and the Red Dragon shall never bow again to the yoke of foreign dominion."

 WAL_march_on_england:0 "March on England"
 WAL_march_on_england_desc:0 "For centuries foreign crowns have arbitrarily redrawn the map of our homeland, cutting Wales from lands that were once ours by history and blood. Now we will press our lawful claim. Through careful research, diplomatic pressure, and historic petitions presented on the international stage, we will demand the return of territories long held under foreign administration. Cymru seeks what is owed by right—not by the sword, but by law, memory, and the undeniable weight of history."
 
 WAL_pact_with_berlin:0 "A Pact with Berlin"

The age of rightful rule returns to the valleys and hills that once bore the Dragon’s mark."

 WAL_britannias_true_heir_desc:0 "When the kings of old fell and the land was divided, prophecy foretold that a true heir would rise from the west — crowned beneath the Dragon’s wings to restore unity to the Isles.

 WAL_british_investment_program_desc:0 "The economic partnership with Britain has opened the doors to unprecedented modernization across Wales. British investors have poured capital into our factories, ports, and rail networks, breathing new life into sectors long burdened by underdevelopment.
