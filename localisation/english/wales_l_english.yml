 # Common/Starting Focuses
 WAL_the_dragon_rises:0 "A New Dawn for Cymru"
 WAL_the_dragon_rises_desc:0 "The chains of the past have been broken, and the spirit of Cymru burns brighter than ever. From the valleys to the coasts, a nation long silenced now roars its defiance to the world. The Red Dragon has awoken, its wings unfurled in triumph — a symbol of unity, strength, and renewal. This is our dawn — the dawn of a free Wales."
 
 WAL_choose_our_path:0 "Choose Our Path"
 WAL_choose_our_path_desc:0 "Independence has brought both pride and peril. Across Cymru, old loyalties and new ideals clash in the streets and in the hearts of its people. The question now looms over every village and valley: what kind of nation will Wales become? The decision cannot be delayed — our destiny awaits, and the world is watching as we choose our path."
 
 # Democratic Path
 WAL_a_democratic_mandate:0 "A Democratic Mandate"
 WAL_a_democratic_mandate_desc:0 "England’s experiment with democracy has withered beneath the weight of its own arrogance and decline. But in Wales, the dream still burns bright. Here, a new nation dares to believe in the strength of the people and the promise of freedom. From Cardiff’s halls to the valleys below, the Welsh voice will speak for democracy — clear, proud, and unwavering — a new light in a darkening continent."
 
 WAL_welsh_national_assembly:0 "Welsh National Assembly"
 WAL_welsh_national_assembly_desc:0 "The time has come to establish a true Welsh National Assembly — a parliament by and for the people of Cymru. From its chambers will emerge the laws, leaders, and ideals that define our young democracy. By giving every citizen a voice in shaping our destiny, we will lay the foundations of a stable, prosperous, and enduring Welsh state."
 
 WAL_the_trade_union_pact:0 "The Trade Union Pact"
 WAL_the_trade_union_pact_desc:0 "The strength of our democracy lies not in the halls of power, but in the hands of its people. By uniting the trade unions and the parliament, we will create a Wales where every citizen — from the miners of the valleys to the sailors of the coast — has a voice. This pact will bind our nation together in fairness, solidarity, and shared purpose."
 
 WAL_allies_in_london:0 "Allies in London"
 WAL_allies_in_london_desc:0 "Old wounds take time to heal, yet the storms gathering across Europe leave little room for grudges. In London, potential allies remain — leaders who see the wisdom of unity against greater foes. By renewing ties with Britain, Wales can secure a friend in diplomacy and a partner in defense, proving that independence and cooperation can coexist beneath the shadow of a dangerous world."
 
 WAL_atlantic_diplomacy:0 "Atlantic Diplomacy"
 WAL_atlantic_diplomacy_desc:0 "For centuries, Welsh sailors have braved the Atlantic’s roaring tides. Now, our nation must do the same in diplomacy. Across the waves lie powerful allies who share our democratic spirit. If we can earn their friendship and trust, the young Welsh state may yet find safe harbor amidst the storm of global politics.."
 
 WAL_cymru_and_europe:0 "Cymru and Europe"
 WAL_cymru_and_europe_desc:0 "As a free and democratic nation, Wales cannot stand idle while Europe’s future hangs in the balance. To preserve peace and uphold the principles we cherish, we must take our place among the family of nations. By aligning ourselves with the democratic powers of Europe — and perhaps joining the Allies — Cymru can ensure that its voice is heard and its freedom protected."
 
 WAL_homegrown_industry:0 "Homegrown Industry"
 WAL_homegrown_industry_desc:0 "The smoke of the old empire’s factories may have faded, but the spirit of Welsh craftsmanship endures. From the steelworks of Port Talbot to the forges of the valleys, a new industrial revival is beginning. By fostering homegrown enterprise and innovation, we can transform Cymru into a nation that thrives not through dependence, but through its own skill and ambition."
 
 WAL_defend_the_west:0 "Defend the West"
 WAL_defend_the_west_desc:0 "The safety of our nation — and of the British Isles as a whole — depends on vigilance along our western shores. We must strengthen our coastal defenses, expand our naval infrastructure, and prepare for any threat that may arise from the turbulent seas beyond. By fortifying the west, Wales will stand as a guardian of the Isles against whatever dangers the future may bring."
 
 # Communist Path
 WAL_red_dragon_rising:0 "Red Dragon Rising"
 WAL_red_dragon_rising_desc:0 "For generations, the workers of Wales have been exploited and silenced. Now, their voices thunder across the valleys in unison. The old order crumbles as the Red Dragon unfurls its crimson wings, heralding the birth of a new Wales — a nation built on equality, unity, and the unbreakable spirit of its people."
 
 WAL_workers_councils:0 "Workers' Councils"
 WAL_workers_councils_desc:0 "The lifeblood of Wales flows through its workers — the miners, the steelmen, the factory hands who built this nation with sweat and struggle. No longer will they answer to absentee owners or foreign profiteers. Every factory, every dock, every mine shall belong to those who labor within them. Through the creation of Workers’ Councils, industry will be guided by the will of the people, not the greed of the few. From now on, Cymru’s wealth will serve its people — not the other way around."
 
 WAL_welsh_soviet_pact:0 "Welsh-Soviet Pact"
 WAL_welsh_soviet_pact_desc:0 "From the valleys of Cymru to the steppes of Russia, the voice of the worker cries out in unison! The capitalist empires tremble as the red banners of Wales and the Soviet Union rise together in defiance. This pact is more than an alliance — it is a declaration of unity among the free peoples of the world. Together, we shall strike the chains from humanity and forge a new order, where labor rules supreme and the oppressors are no more!"
 
 WAL_the_miners_revolution:0 "The Miners' Revolution"
 WAL_the_miners_revolution_desc:0 "From the depths of the coal pits and slate quarries, the heartbeat of the Welsh revolution thunders. For generations, miners have endured the darkness, their sweat and sacrifice fueling empires that gave them nothing in return. Now, they rise as the vanguard of the socialist cause — disciplined, united, and unbreakable. The mines that once chained them now forge their liberation. The Red Dragon roars with the voice of the miners, and the earth itself trembles with revolution."
 
 WAL_break_chains_of_capital:0 "Break the Chains of Capital"
 WAL_break_chains_of_capital_desc:0 "Tear down the mansions! Empty the boardrooms! The age of the capitalist oppressor is over! The people of Wales will no longer bleed for the greed of the few. Every factory, every farm, every forge shall be seized in the name of the revolution and administered by the people’s state. From this day forward, Cymru belongs to its workers — the chains of capital lie shattered beneath the Red Dragon’s claws!"
 
 WAL_export_the_revolution:0 "Export the Revolution"
 WAL_export_the_revolution_desc:0 "The Red Dragon will not be content with freedom for Cymru alone. The chains that bind workers across these isles and beyond must be smashed — and Wales will carry the torch of liberation into Scotland, Ireland, and every land that yearns for emancipation! We shall aid uprisings, inspire the comrades, and fan the flames of revolution until the old empires crumble. From Cardiff to Cork and Glasgow to Limerick, the workers will rise — and Wales will stand at their side."
 
 WAL_a_welsh_internationale:0 "A Welsh Internationale"
 WAL_a_welsh_internationale_desc:0 "To lead an Internationale is to shape thought as well as arms. Welsh theorists, poets, and organizers will craft a living doctrine that adapts Marxist principles to the particular struggles of smaller nations and oppressed peoples. The Welsh Internationale will offer not just weapons and money, but a rallying culture and a doctrine that proves socialism can be forged outside the great powers."
 
 WAL_a_peoples_army:0 "A People's Army"
 WAL_a_peoples_army_desc:0 "Every worker must be ready to defend the revolution!"
 
 # Fascist Path
 WAL_rise_of_the_dragon:0 "The Rise of the Dragon"
 WAL_rise_of_the_dragon_desc:0 "The old world has failed. Democracy falters, socialism divides, and foreign influence poisons our soil. Only through discipline and strong leadership can Wales rise above the chaos. Our people long for stability, pride, and greatness — and we will give it to them. Under the Dragon’s shadow, a new empire will rise — forged by will, fire, and the unbreakable strength of Cymru."
 
 WAL_purging_british_influence:0 "Purging British Influence"
 WAL_purging_british_influence_desc:0 "For centuries, British rule sought not only to govern Wales but to erase it — our language silenced, our people shamed, our children made to wear the cursed Welsh Knot for speaking their mother tongue. No more. Those days of humiliation will be avenged through decisive reform and renewal. British officials will be removed from our institutions, their laws undone, their symbols erased. The tongue once punished shall now command, and the Red Dragon shall never bow again to the yoke of foreign dominion."
 
 WAL_cymru_for_the_cymry:0 "Cymru for the Cymry"
 WAL_cymru_for_the_cymry_desc:0 "The time has come to place Cymru above all. The nation must stand united — one people, one purpose, one destiny. Every citizen will be called to serve the rebirth of the Welsh state; loyalty, discipline, and devotion will be the virtues that bind us together. The Dragon demands strength, and through unity of will, Wales shall become unbreakable."
 
 WAL_revive_the_druidic_order:0 "Revive the Druidic Order"
 WAL_revive_the_druidic_order_desc:0 "The roots of Wales run deep, older than the crown, older than the church, older than empire itself. The wisdom of the druids — long suppressed by foreign powers — will be restored as the foundation of our new national faith. Ceremonies, symbols, and ancient rites shall remind every citizen that our strength is not just of flesh and steel, but of spirit and soil. Cymru’s rebirth will be both political and sacred."
 
 WAL_march_on_england:0 "March on England"
 WAL_march_on_england_desc:0 "For centuries foreign crowns have arbitrarily redrawn the map of our homeland, cutting Wales from lands that were once ours by history and blood. Now we will press our lawful claim. Through careful research, diplomatic pressure, and historic petitions presented on the international stage, we will demand the return of territories long held under foreign administration. Cymru seeks what is owed by right—not by the sword, but by law, memory, and the undeniable weight of history."
 
 WAL_pact_with_berlin:0 "A Pact with Berlin"
 WAL_pact_with_berlin_desc:0 "The great powers of the continent are shifting, and only those with the courage to act will shape the new Europe. Germany has extended its hand, offering us a place within a new continental order built on strength, unity, and destiny. By forging this pact, we align ourselves with a rising power that understands our vision — an unyielding Europe, forged in discipline and purpose. Cymru shall stand beside Berlin as a loyal partner in the forging of a new age.."
 
 WAL_dominance_of_celtic_isles:0 "Dominance of the Celtic Isles"
 WAL_dominance_of_celtic_isles_desc:0 "Wales will no longer whisper its demands — we will make them thunder. Mobilize the legions, parade our banners on the coast, and issue our demands with the force of a nation prepared for anything. Let London see that a people united and armed is not to be trifled with."
 
 WAL_the_welsh_war_machine:0 "The Welsh War Machine"
 WAL_the_welsh_war_machine_desc:0 "The Dragon’s fire burns hottest in the forge of war. The nation will be reforged — its people hardened, its industries awakened, its spirit unbreakable. Fields will yield steel, songs will echo like drums of thunder, and the roar of engines will be the voice of a reborn Cymru. A single purpose now drives us: victory."
 
 # Monarchist Path
 WAL_return_of_the_true_king:0 "The Return of the True King"
 WAL_return_of_the_true_king_desc:0 "The bards once sang of a king who would return when Wales was free and the land called for its protector once more. That time has come. From hidden lineage and ancient prophecy, a descendant of Owain Glyndŵr steps forth to reclaim the throne. His coronation will not merely crown a man, but awaken the spirit of the nation — the Dragon’s heir returned to guide Cymru into a new golden age."
 
 WAL_court_of_cymru:0 "The Court of Cymru"
 WAL_court_of_cymru_desc:0 "The return of the crown demands a court worthy of legend. Within the halls of marble and oak, nobles, poets, warriors, and scholars will gather once more beneath the Dragon Banner. This court shall not merely rule, but inspire — a living symbol of Welsh unity and destiny. From its throne, decrees will echo like verses of prophecy, binding past and future in royal splendour. Cymru shall once again be ruled in majesty."
 
 WAL_new_arthurian_age:0 "A New Arthurian Age"
 WAL_new_arthurian_age_desc:0 "From Camelot’s echoes to the halls of Cardiff, the legends of old live once more. The tales of Arthur, Merlin, and the noble knights will no longer belong to story alone, but to the spirit of a people reborn. Guided by honour and destiny, the king’s court shall revive the virtues of the old age — courage, loyalty, and justice — and carry them into a new golden dawn for Cymru."
 
 WAL_the_celtic_crown:0 "The Celtic Crown"
 WAL_the_celtic_crown_desc:0 "The old prophecies spoke of a king who would unite the Celtic peoples beneath one banner, restoring the harmony that once bound our isles. That time has come. From the highlands of Alba to the green shores of Éire, the ancient crowns shall be gathered into one — the Celtic Crown of Cymru. Under the Dragon Throne, our kindred nations will rise together, guided by shared heritage, faith, and destiny. The bards will call this the age when the Celts became one people once more."
 
 WAL_a_kings_army:0 "A King's Army"
 WAL_a_kings_army_desc:0 "From the mists of legend to the fields of battle, the King’s Army shall embody the spirit of Cymru itself — fierce as the Dragon, steadfast as the mountains. Each soldier will swear their oath not merely to a flag, but to the sacred destiny of a restored realm. The bards will sing of their courage, and the enemies of the crown will tremble at their approach. The age of noble warriors has returned."
 
 WAL_royal_treaty_france:0 "A Royal Treaty with France"
 WAL_royal_treaty_france_desc:0 "To secure our crown, we must find allies among Europe’s monarchies.

Through this treaty, our two kingdoms will cooperate in trade, defence, and diplomacy — bound not only by shared interest, but by the enduring fellowship of kings."
 
 WAL_restoring_marcher_borders:0 "Restoring the Marcher Borders"
 WAL_restoring_marcher_borders_desc:0 "History may have erased the borders of old Wales, but the crown remembers. The Marcher lands, taken in the age of conquest, are bound to Cymru by heritage and divine right. Under royal command, we will move to restore our ancient frontier — a border defined not by empire, but by destiny. The age of rightful rule returns to the valleys and hills that once bore the Dragon’s mark."
 
 WAL_britannias_true_heir:0 "Britannia's True Heir"
 WAL_britannias_true_heir_desc:0 "When the kings of old fell and the land was divided, prophecy foretold that a true heir would rise from the west — crowned beneath the Dragon’s wings to restore unity to the Isles. That prophecy has come to pass. The false crowns of London will fade, and the rightful sovereign of Britannia shall reign from Cymru, where honour, blood, and destiny converge."

 # Rejoin the union path
